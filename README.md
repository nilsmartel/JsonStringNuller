# JsonStringNuller

This is an experiment with manipulating json data.
A step below proper fuzzing, I derive (possibly) invalid data from valid data,
in order to find flaws in my api.

Particularly in setting string values to empty string.

## This is not an application

These java snippets are ment to be copy+pasted and slightly modified to fit my usecase.
Pooling them in a library would overcomplicate things,
as I expect to come back to these and make slight alterations anyway.
